# TickChain

## Hello friend 

Welcome to `TickChain`. This is my final project for the Consensys Academy developer program.
It is essentially a decentralized ticketing system. It allows for a ticket seller to sell tickets, and for users to securely buy and sell tickets from the ticket seller / second-hand tickets.
The advantage here compared to centralized systems is :
- Protection against forgery : Tickets are blockchain-issued, and their ownership is tracked on the blockchain. No more fake tickets, users can verify that a ticket is legit simply by entering its address.
- Ownership tracking: You can quickly see who currently owns a ticket, as well as the ticket history 
- Scarcity: Tickets are issued on the Ethereum blockchain using the non-fungible standard for tokens ERC-721. Each of them are unique by design. 

## Get started 

- To start the project, simply run 
	- `npm install` / `yarn`
	- `yarn dev` / `npm run dev`
